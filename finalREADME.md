## My process

I used tailwindcss for the first time and it was a hands own experience ðŸ˜†. On the second day of working on this project I had some issues with some default colors styles not working due to some bug in my tailwind config file I initially didn't notice. After about a day with this problem I fixed it with some changes and I got back to coding.

I initially started with my desktop design to later find out that tailwind encourages mobile design first as that is how the framework was built. It was tough trying to go around this but I got it eventually.

I still currently have some issues with the transitions in tailwind. I will go on to read more about it. Suggestions are absolutely encouraged. Thanks

### Built with
[React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
[Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) -CSS framework


### What I learned
- I finally got started with tailwindcss, yay!!
- It was great as I also implemented React which I am currently learing

### Continued development
- Definitely learing more animations and transitions in tailwind and css in general
